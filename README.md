# Factors-Driving-the-Increase

# Overview :

In this excercise you were asked to use the Analyze feature in Microsoft Power BI to explain unexpected increases in sales totals and provide insights on the reasons for these increases. 

More specifically, you were asked to:

   • Use clustering in a Scatter chart to add product clusters that would assist the Analyze feature.

   • Create a Line chart from the sales figures to identify the dates where a sales surge occurred, and then use the Analyze feature to detect the reason for these increases.

   • Add to the report all the relevant visualizations based on the insights generated by the Explain the increase tool in Power BI.

# "Analyzing the Growth"

# Step 1: Download the Data

  Download the Power BI report file Adventure Works Sales Report.pbix and open it in Power BI Desktop.

# Step 2: Identify Key Sales Spikes

  1. Navigate to the Data View in Power BI, select the Sales table, and familiarize yourself with the dataset.

  2. Find the Order Date column and the Order Total column in the Sales table. Additionally, identify an attribute column suitable for clustering. In this case, the Product Name column has high cardinality (a large number of distinct 

     values) and is a good candidate for clustering.

  3. Switch to the Report View in Power BI. Then, create a Line Chart visualization with Order Date on the X-axis and Order Total on the Y-axis.

  4. Using the Line Chart created in the previous step, identify the 3rd and 7th of March as the two distinct days when there was a noticeable spike in sales.
